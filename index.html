<h1>Hello from Hopscotch Solutions!</h1>

The Hopscotch patent pending algorithm uses an intelligent software seating model with learning routines to optimally reseat passengers. Passengers can now directly exchange seats with one another at the gate, prior to boarding their flight.
<p>Users interface with SeatBot via a smartphone app. The app coordinates user interaction with the Hopscotch API. SeatBot ranks potential seat matches using vector dot products and a clustering algorithm. SeatBot acts as a seat matchmaker by considering each person involved in every potential exchange.</p>
<p>The algorithm constructs a 3-dimensional model, like a contour map, of each passengerâ€™s seating preferences. The model is cross-referenced to each user's seat preference vector using a 2-dimensional seat map and seat prototype model of the aircraft used for a flight. The vectors also map between the orthogonal view of the cabin, meaning at a 90-degree angle to the cabin axes. This generates a seating "heat map" of desirability for each passenger in a new way: row and column attributes of each seat location.</p>
<p>SeatBot generates a relative preference contour with seat desirability as the height, also known as magnitude. This magnitude intuitively translates to the seat happiness gradient for each user and a particular seat. The algorithm evaluates and compares the differential change in satisfaction between the current seat and the seat under consideration.</p>
<p>Hopscotch seeks to maximize those seat exchanges that generate beneficial happiness using a point system. The points offered for accepting a potential swap depends on four general considerations:</p>
<p>1) Where you prefer to sit on this flight.</p>
<p>2) How you feel about your current seat assignment.</p>
<p>3) Where the person in your desired seat prefers to sit.</p>
<p>4) How the person assigned to your desired seat feels about your current seat.</p>
<p>SeatBot seeks to maximize the pre-negotiated seat exchanges using the Hopscotch patent pending algorithm. Passenger matches of mutual benefit generate mutual benefit for all passengers by silently arranging seat exchanges prior to boarding.</p>
